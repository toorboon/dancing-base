## About this app

This is app was written to support me with my extensive videobase where I keep all my dancing videos. It has some of the features you would find on youtube. The main goal was to provide me with a tool to practice my own videos together with my partner during Corona times.

The theme is a dark one, though you can easily change that in the layout back to the standard laravel theme.

## Future prospects?

I might add a multi user login system in the future so you could use the app for dancing schools to give your pupils access to the classes they booked (you could use this like a CMS).
